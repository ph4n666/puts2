#this is an assignment that focuses on api interface and its implementation testing and version tracking.
#the API used is flask and git for version management.All the work has been done in branches and then merged to master(in merging I messed things up and the merging was once again done (you can see it in the log)) but at the end versions were managed. 
#requirements :able to add ,divide , multiply, subtract any rational number and the api is flask and each feature is built and tested indivudally in branches and the flask api is accessed via http interface.
#this is an extension of the repo https://github.com/patrikarlos/puts2.
